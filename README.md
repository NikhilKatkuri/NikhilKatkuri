# Hey there! 👋

I'm Nikhil, a 2nd-year B.Tech CSE (Data Science) student at HITAM, Hyderabad.  
Self-taught full-stack developer who ships real things — even if most of my tabs say “40% done”.  
I love code. I love design even more. Turning ideas into something people can actually click is pure magic to me.

**Tech Stack**  
React 19 • TypeScript • JavaScript • Node.js • Next.js 14 (App Router) • Tailwind CSS • Express • Firebase • REST APIs

**Mobile & Cross-Platform (currently learning & obsessed)**  
Flutter • Dart • Expo 

**Tools & Workflow**  
Git • GitHub Actions • Figma • CLI-first everything

**Currently Exploring**  
MongoDB • System Design • “How to actually finish projects”

## The Real Story (100% honest)

- I have few repos right now.  
- Exactly 1 is properly finished (MVP) and published → **git-lite-cli**  
  One-command repo bootstrapping. From 2-5 mins of pain to 18 seconds.  
  Node.js • TypeScript • Octokit  
  v1.2.1 live • 1,039 total downloads • Peak day 430 🔥  
  → npmjs.com/package/git-lite-cli

- The other ? Somewhere between 10–70% done (classic indie dev energy).  
  Hitam Connect (campus super-app), SkyNote (encrypted messenger), few half-built projects, and one quiz app that still works somehow.

I’m the guy with 200 tabs open and 50 half-baked ideas, but I’m learning to ship more and dream slightly less.

Still in college. Still figuring it out. Still shipping anyway.  
Let’s build something - finished or not - together! 🚀
